# GEN Hack Project

## Project

- Where's the Beef? / Pihvi
- Highlight the most powerful news content

## What do we want?

- We want to encourage participation and constructive interaction
- We want to create our analytics and to know what is meaningful content 
- Article is not the basic unit of news anymore, we want something more fine-grained

## What is the problem?

- Many news medias place user comments after the article
- Lack of context, misunderstandings, takes more time to write
- How many of you actually write comments on any news article?

## What solutions exist?

- [Genius Web Annotator](http://genius.com/web-annotator), example: [Annotated transcript: The Aug. 6 GOP debate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/06/annotated-transcript-the-aug-6-gop-debate/)
